# sms-bot

This sms-bot does an analysis of an inbound message to find keywords which trigger a response. The keywords in this version are 'pizza' and 'ice cream'.  

## Requirements

- Flask 
- Ngrok
- Python 3.6+
- Telnyx Python SDK

## Installation

1. First, you'll need to install [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/). Flask is a framework that will allow to handle HTTP requests. Think of it as a local server.

   ```pip install flask```

2. Next, you'll need a tunneling tool. I recommend ngrok. ngrok allows you to expose your local server (Flask) to the internet. In our case, it will allow you to receive webhooks from inbound messages to the app. Instructions on how to download ngrok can be found [here](https://ngrok.com/download).

## Usage
